    <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
    <p>A chocolate brownie or simply a brownie is a square or rectangular chocolate baked confection. Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, 
        depending on their density. Brownies often, but not always, have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust. They may also include nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate chips, 
        or other ingredients. A variation made with brown sugar and vanilla rather than choco batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. T
        he brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized there during the first half of the 20th century.</p>
