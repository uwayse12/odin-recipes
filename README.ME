The current project I am working on will be a main site which has links to other webpages using relative links, this is my first project and has gone as expected. I was able to create all three webpages without having to use my notes. The main site has 2 different recipes, one for Margharita Pizza and one for Kheer. I have added paragraphs, images, relative links, headers and also utilised Strong tag. This has been an amazing first project and hope to make more advanced sites as I learn more.
